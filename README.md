# SeamCarving

The seam carving project proposed our implementation of the Seam Carving and of some of its coolest extension.
We will also try to find new exiting tools based on SeamCarving.

Members of the team:
- Maxime Cautr√®s
- Thomas Pickles

Supervisor:
- David Coeurjolly
- Vincent Nivoliers

TODO:
[] Have a look at Pillow [PIL.ImageFilter](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/ImageFilter.html) library.  A whole range of different filters and image processing tools available there, and they _may be_ (I haven't checked this) optimised for faster execution.

Done:
[x] Implementing the seam carving for picture
[x] Implementing a better autosave - option to overwrite (-f), or will write to a new timestamped path.

### How to run code
